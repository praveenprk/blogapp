# About this project

I've created this project as the FRONT END ONLY using ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, & MUI. I am using JSON Typicode Placeholder here. This project contains blogs, users, & albums so far. While creating this project, I wanted to focus completely on ReactJS and not any backend tech.


# Getting Started with Blog App

### `npm install`

Once, you see the node_modules folder succesfully appearing, 

Run
### `npm start`


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
